# üèÜ Hackathon Bounty Board

## Description

The Hackathon Bounty Board is a decentralized smart contract built on the Aptos blockchain that revolutionizes how hackathon rewards are distributed. This innovative platform enables hackathon organizers to create milestone-based bounties with automatic, transparent payouts as teams progress through different stages of development.

### Key Features

- **üéØ Milestone-Based Payments**: Rewards are divided into 3 equal milestones, ensuring steady motivation and progress tracking
- **üí∞ Secure Fund Management**: Organizers fund bounties upfront, with funds securely held until milestone completion
- **üîí Transparent Verification**: All transactions are recorded on the Aptos blockchain for complete transparency
- **‚ö° Instant Payouts**: Milestone payments are released immediately upon verification
- **üõ°Ô∏è Smart Contract Security**: Built-in safeguards prevent unauthorized access and ensure fair distribution

### How It Works

1. **Create Bounty**: Hackathon organizers deposit the total reward amount and specify the participating team
2. **Track Progress**: Teams work through three predefined milestones (Prototype ‚Üí MVP ‚Üí Final Submission)
3. **Release Payments**: Organizers verify milestone completion and trigger automatic payments (33.33% per milestone)
4. **Complete Project**: Once all milestones are achieved, the bounty is automatically closed

## Vision

Our vision is to transform the hackathon ecosystem by creating a trustless, transparent, and efficient reward distribution system that:

- **Eliminates Payment Delays**: No more waiting weeks or months for prize money
- **Increases Participation**: Clear milestone structure motivates teams to stay engaged
- **Builds Trust**: Blockchain transparency ensures fair and verifiable transactions
- **Promotes Innovation**: Steady funding enables teams to focus on building rather than worrying about payments
- **Scales Globally**: Decentralized infrastructure supports hackathons worldwide

### Impact Goals

- Enable **1000+ hackathons** to use milestone-based rewards by 2025
- Distribute **$10M+ in bounties** through the platform
- Create a **global standard** for hackathon reward systems
